<p>The Haywards beer brand is most well known for its iconic Haywards 5000 strong lager, which contains 7% alcohol. The brand was launched in 1974, with the Haywards 2000 mild beer, as an extension of the renowned Haywards liquor brand (which was founded in the early 1900s). Haywards 5000 subsequently hit the market in 1978. Recently, in 2015, SABMiller launched a Haywards 5000 BOLD beer that's brewed for 48 hours longer and has a full-bodied taste. Haywards also produces a rarer super strong Haywards 10000. Haywards has a market share of 12%, and is consumed the most in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Chattisgarh.</p>

<p>The Haywards brand of liquor was founded by Britisher Sir Anthony Hayward, and two of his grandchildren run a fantastic heritage bed and breakfast in south Goa. The bar serves Haywards 5000, of course. And there's free beer for anyone who can beat the drinking record.</p>
