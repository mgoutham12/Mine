<p>A true Carlsberg classic, Elephant Beer was first launched way back in 1959. The elephant represents both strength of the beer and an exotic taste, or at least that’s what the pen notes say.</p>

<p>The inspiration came from Architect J. L. Dahlerup who, in 1901, created a tower resting on four elephants carved in granite. He in turn got the idea from the Minerva Square in Rome, where an obelisk supports an elephant.</p>

<p>This became known as The Elephant Gate and today is part of the main entrance to the brewery in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The four elephants each bear the initial of one of Carl Jacobsen’s children: Theodora, Vagn, Helge and Paula. Carl Jacobsen, of course, is the son of Jacob Christian Jacobsen, the founder of the Carlsberg brewery.</p>

<p>Since then, the Elephant Gate has been a famous Danish landmark, and this is why Elephant beer is so important to the Carlsberg group, representing both historic and family ties.</p>

<p>The Elephant beer is made in the Carlsberg Brewery in Copenhagen and exported all around the world.</p>
